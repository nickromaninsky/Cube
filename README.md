How to run the program

Step One: Downloading Files

Open the Git Hub repository (the URL where the project resides.)
Click the green "Code" button, then "Download Zip" at the bottom.


Step Two: Downloading Python


Windows:

    Open the "Power Shell" app on your computer.
    Type "python" into Power Shell and wait for the Microsoft Store to pop up.
    Download Python version 3.9, NOT any other version.

Mac:

    Go to www.python.org
    Download Python version 3.9, NOT any other version.

Step Three: Downloading Libraries

Still in Power Shell or terminal, type in "pip3 install pygame", then click enter.
If this does not work, type "pip install pygame", then click enter.

Type in "pip3 install rubik_solver", then click enter.
If this does not work, type "pip install rubik_solver", then click enter.

Step Four: Run the Program

Windows Users:

    Open the "Files" app and find the "Cube-main" zip folder that you downloaded.
    Right click on the folder and click "Extract All".
    In the popup, delete "\Cube-main" from the text box and click "Extract". (This ensures that the "Cube-main" folder is directly in the Downloads and not in any other folder or sub folder.)
    Delete the original Cube-main zip folder.
    Open the "Power Shell" and type "cd Downloads\Cube-main"

    Type in "python cubeSolver.py" to the Power Shell, then click enter.
    If this does not work, type "python3 cubeSolver.py", then click enter.

Mac Users:

    Type in "cd " with a space at the end into the terminal but do NOT click enter.
    Open the finder.
    Find the "Cube" folder in your recent files.
    Click and drag it into the terminal, then open the terminal and click enter.

    Type in "python cubeSolver.py" to your terminal, then click enter.
    If this does not work, type "python3 cubeSolver.py", then click enter.

Have fun!
